            How to use Lafore WorkshopApplets in 2019


Date: 11.03.2019
Java version: 8 update 201 (build 1.8.0_201_b09)

Needed change security settings in Java to run it. One of methods to run applets:

1. Use link: https://cs.brynmawr.edu/Courses/cs206/spring2004/lafore.html and add this link to security exception list in Java-Security.
2. Use exception list. For me path is: file:///C:/Coding/Java/Books/WorkshopApplets/Chap03/Selection/SelectSort.html

You can change exception  file C:\Users\%profile%\AppData\LocalLow\Sun\Java\Deployment\security\exception.sites and add its string

file:///C:/Coding/Java/Books/WorkshopApplets/Chap03/Selection/SelectSort.html


Hope this remarks will be helpfull!
